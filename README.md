# Cookooi

Cookooi is a local recipe prototype. Enter ingredients you already have, add what you are craving, and the app suggests three meal ideas with used ingredients and items still needed.

## Run

```powershell
npm start
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3004
```

When the local Cloudflare tunnel is active, the same local service is available at:

```text
https://cookooi.creabooboard.win
```

`npm start` runs the Cloudflare Workers Static Assets runtime through Wrangler. The browser assets live in `public/`, matching the Worker asset configuration in `wrangler.jsonc`.

For a simple Node static fallback during local debugging, run:

```powershell
npm run start:node
```

The app is static and stores saved recipes in the browser's local storage. No AI behavior is changed by this runtime task.
